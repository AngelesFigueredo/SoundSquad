- **Profile page** - At this view, you will be able to access to your friend's playlists, their friends list, and their events. If it's your profile page, you will be able to edit your info too.
- **Playlist pages** You'll found a main playlists view, where you will find your or your friends' playlists named and, if you clic them, you'll see a detail page where you will be able to listen a preview os every song.
- **Listen! page** Let your phone recognize music for you! At this view, you will find that music that you love and that is playing on the radio, but that you do not know yet. When a song is found, you'll see the song details view.

And here, you will find a list of events related to the show, and the option of creating your own event. **This is the main functionality of the app**.
- **Event details** If you are owner or member of a concert's event, you'll find at its details page a live chat where you'll talk with your new (or not) friends, and you will prepare all the details for the concert. A great way for meeting people, isn't it?
- **DMs** You can talk to any user with direct messages too!
- **Notifications** Here, you will see the friendship requests, if a friend has shared an event with you that it thinks may interest you, a list of posts and comments mentions to yourself...

## Server Routes

This app has many routes, so we have grouped them into the following routers.

- **Index routes**: the main routes are here. Search bar logic, profiles, notifications.
- **AudD routes**: for all the recognizing stuff.
- **Auth routes**: for all credential related matters
- **Post routes**: creating, deleting, displaying, mentions at posts
- **Comment routes**: creating, deleting, displaying... comments
- **Events routes**: with the logic of creating an event, accepting an user to join an event...
- **Events' chat routes**: for the inside working of every single event chat, and the way of sharing events to your friends.
- **Messages routes**: for the DMs working.
- **Playlists routes**: here, you'll find the music things, like creating a playlist, taking a song...


Here, we show you some of that routes:
